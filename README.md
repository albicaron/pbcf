# `pbcf`: Probit Bayesian Causal Forests
Implements Probit version of Bayesian Causal Forests by [Hahn et. al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.09523.pdf), for binary type of outcomes (0 or 1).
The code is based on the `bcf` package of [Hahn et. al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.09523.pdf), and mainly taken from the extended version of the package by [Starling et. al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09405.pdf).
